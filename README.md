# MOSAICurriculum

**Memory-Orchestrated Symbolic Agent Intelligent Curriculum**

Memory → Letta Cloud  
Orchestrated → LangGraph  
Symbolic → Neo4j Knowledge Graph  
Agent → Multi-agent system (Solver, Assessment, Feedback, KG Builder)  
Intelligent → LLM-powered reasoning via Groq / LLaMA 3.3 70B  
Curriculum → AI/ML tutoring domain  

**Multi-agent AI tutor for learning Data Science and AI/ML concepts.**
**Built with LLaMA 3.3 70B, Letta Cloud memory, RAG (Pinecone + BGE-small), Neo4j knowledge graph, and Streamlit.**

Accessible @ https://mosaicurriculum.streamlit.app/

## How the agents work

```
Student message
      ↓
Orchestrator (LangGraph) — chat-first routing
      ↓ brief answer + "want to know more?"
      ↓ (user says yes)
Solver Agent        — explains using RAG (Pinecone) + KG + Letta memory
      ↓
Assessment Agent    — generates question, scores answer 0-100
      ↓
Feedback Agent      — diagnoses right/wrong, updates KG colors, decides next step
      ↓
Decision: re-teach (→ Solver) or advance (→ next concept)
```

All three agents share **one Letta Cloud memory agent per student**, keyed by student ID.

### Orchestrator routing priority
```
1. Assessment keywords (test me, quiz me) → redirect to Assessment Tab
2. Pending concept followup (user said yes) → Solver full lesson
3. Casual chat keywords (hi, thanks) → friendly chat
4. LLM classifier → brief answer or chat
```

## First-time setup

### Step 1 — Copy environment file
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your actual values
```

### Step 2 — Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3 — Set up required services

**Neo4j AuraDB** (free cloud instance)
- Create at https://neo4j.com/cloud/aura/
- Copy URI, username, password to secrets

**Letta Cloud** (persistent memory)
- Sign up at https://app.letta.com
- Copy API key to secrets

**Groq API** (LLM inference)
- Sign up at https://console.groq.com
- Copy API key to secrets — free tier available

**Pinecone** (vector database)
- Sign up at https://app.pinecone.io
- Create index named `mosaicurriculum`, dimension `384`, metric `cosine`, region `us-east-1`
- Copy API key to secrets

### Step 4 — Add documents to RAG
```
Drop any PDF, HTML, TXT, or MD files into the docs/ folder.
The app will automatically ingest them into Pinecone on first startup.
Topic area is inferred from filename keywords:
  pandas, numpy, matplotlib → python_data_science
  stats, probability        → statistics_probability
  eda, wrangling, cleaning  → data_wrangling_eda
  anything else             → general
```

### Step 5 — Run locally (optional)
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
Only needed if running locally for development. The live app is already deployed at https://mosaicurriculum.streamlit.app/

## Deploying to Streamlit Cloud

Add these secrets in your Streamlit Cloud dashboard:

```toml
LETTA_API_KEY = 'sk-let-...'
LETTA_BASE_URL = 'https://....com'
NEO4J_URI='neo4j+s://....databases.neo4j.io'
NEO4J_USER='...'
NEO4J_PASSWORD='...'
GROQ_API_KEY = '...'
GROQ_API_KEY_EVAL='...'
LLM_PROVIDER = 'groq'
LLM_MODEL = "openai/gpt-..."
PINECONE_API_KEY='...'
GEMINI_API_KEY='...'
HF_TOKEN='...'
```

On first deploy, the app will automatically download and ingest all files in `docs/` into Pinecone. Subsequent deploys skip already-ingested files instantly.

## Using the tutor

The Streamlit interface has three tabs on the left panel:

**💬 Chat tab** — talk to the Solver Agent
```
"Explain gradient descent"
"What is a DataFrame?"
"How does K-Means clustering work?"
```
The tutor gives a brief answer first, then offers a deeper explanation if you want one.

**📝 Assessment tab** — test your understanding
```
1. Enter a concept name (e.g. "pandas DataFrame")
2. Click "Get Question"
3. Write your answer
4. Submit — see score + Feedback Agent diagnosis
5. Feedback Agent decides: re-teach or advance
```

**⚙️ Settings tab** — configuration and tools
- Your session ID is auto-generated (`student_XXXX`) — use the same ID on different devices to share progress
- Response style: Concise / Balanced / Detailed
- Difficulty override: Auto / Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced
- Export chat history as `.txt`
- RAG tools: Check RAG Status, Clear Pinecone, Debug PDF

The **Knowledge Graph** (sidebar) appears automatically once 2+ concepts are indexed.
Node colors update live as you learn:

| Color  | Meaning               |
|--------|-----------------------|
| Grey   | Not yet studied       |
| Blue   | Currently studying    |
| Yellow | Being assessed        |
| Green  | Mastered              |
| Red    | Needs review          |
| Orange | Prerequisite gap      |

## Key design decisions

| Decision | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| Pinecone instead of ChromaDB | ChromaDB is local — data wiped on every Streamlit Cloud redeploy. Pinecone is persistent cloud storage |
| Incremental ingestion | Only new files are processed on startup — safe to redeploy without re-ingesting everything |
| Chat-first routing | Prevents the tutor from launching into full lessons unprompted — student opts in |
| Auto student ID | Each session gets a unique ID so multiple students can use the same deployment independently |
| No FastAPI backend | Streamlit directly calls agents — simpler deployment, no separate backend process needed |
